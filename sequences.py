#------- DATA STRUCTURES -------#

#List - sequence of mutable values
#Mutable values - means you change any values in the list

#Tuple - sequence of immutable values
#Immutable values - this values cannot change u need to create another tuple to change something

#Set - collection of unique values
#Set - it does not collect in particular order (its just a collection every value needs to be unique)

#Dict - collection of key-value pairs
#Dict - it was like literally a dictionary(when u look a value u get some other value)
#Dict - if u find a especific key you will get another value








#name = "Harry"
#we start the every sequence with 0
#what are we doing here is indexing
#print(name[1])

#List = this one is called list. we created a variable name (name) with the list of strings inside of it 
#name = ["Harry", "Ron",  "Lamaw"]
#print(name[0])

#Tuples 
#coordinate = (10.0 , 20.0)
#print(coordinate[0])
